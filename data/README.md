## About

This dataset, from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds), contains measurements of geometrical properties of kernels belonging to three different varieties of wheat. A soft X-ray technique and GRAINS package were used to construct all seven, real-valued attributes.

Manual clean up of the data was required to ensure that the correct number of tab delimited columns was uniform across the dataset.
